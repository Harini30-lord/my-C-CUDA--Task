C++ Statistical (C++ Modern 17-- version):

* This is  four fundamental statistical measures: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation. It operates on a pre-defined set of numbers located directly in the source code to demonstrate the calculation logic.

* //Mean: The average of all the numbers in the dataset.
//Median: The middle value after the dataset has been sorted.
//Variance: A measure of how spread out the data points are.
//Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance, also showing the data's spread.

* uses and Run -std=c++17 online GDB Compiler: This is important because the code uses a C++17 feature (structured bindings) to handle the results neatly.


"How the Code Works"

The program's logic is straightforward and separated into two main parts:

The main() function:

-A std::vector named my_data is created and filled with a hard-coded list of numbers: {2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9}.
It calls the calculate_statistics function, passing this data to it.screen in a formatted way.

-The calculate_statistics() function:
This function receives the list of numbers and performs all the calculations.
//
Mean: It uses std::accumulate to sum all the numbers, then divides by the count.

Median: It first sorts the data using std::sort. Then, it finds the middle value. If there's an even number of items, it averages the two middle values.

Variance: It calculates how far each number is from the mean, squares that difference, and finds the average of all those squared differences.

Standard Deviation: It simply calculates the square root of the variance.

Finally, it returns all four results together.

Program Output and Error Handling:

Getting the Output
When you run the compiled program, it will immediately perform the calculations on its pre-defined dataset and print the following results. 

Output:

Data set: {2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9}
-----------------------------------
Mean               : 5.0000
Median             : 4.5000
Variance           : 4.0000
Standard Deviation : 2.0000

"Error Handling"

The main potential error in a program like this is trying to calculate statistics on an empty dataset, which would cause a "division by zero" error when calculating the mean.
