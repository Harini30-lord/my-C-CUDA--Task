"C++ 3D Vector" :

      This is a simple yet powerful header-style C++ library for performing common 3D vector algebra. It uses C++ templates, which allows it to work with different numeric data types like int, float, or double.

**The library supports the following vector operations:

<<Basic Arithmetic: Addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication.
<<Magnitude: Calculating the length of a vector.
<<Dot Product: Calculating the dot product of two vectors.
<<Cross Product: Calculating the cross product of two vectors.
<<Normalization: Finding the unit vector (length 1) in the same direction as a given vector.

Function of Code:

     The program's output is generated by the main() function, which performs a series of tests:

--Test Case 1: It creates two vectors of type int (v1 and v2) and performs all the basic arithmetic, dot product, and cross product operations on them.

--Test Case 2: It creates three vectors of type double (a, b, and c) to demonstrate operations where precision is important, like magnitude and normalization.

Printing: Each result is printed to the console using std::cout. The special operator<< function is used to automatically format the vectors in a readable (x, y, z) format.

Output:

--- Test Case 1: Integer Vectors ---
v1 = (1, 2, 3)
v2 = (4, 5, 6)
v1 + v2 = (5, 7, 9)
v1 - v2 = (-3, -3, -3)
v1 * 3 = (3, 6, 9)
Dot Product(v1, v2) = 32
Cross Product(v1, v2) = (-3, 6, -3)
Magnitude of v1 = 3.00

--- Test Case 2: Double Precision Vectors ---
a = (1.00, 0.00, 0.00)
b = (0.00, 1.00, 0.00)
c = (3.00, 4.00, 0.00)
Dot Product(a, b) = 0.00
Cross Product(a, b) = (0.00, 0.00, 1.00)
Magnitude of c = 5.00
Normalized c = (0.60, 0.80, 0.00)
Magnitude of normalized c = 1.00


Explanation of Important Functions:

--magnitude(): Calculates the length (or size) of the vector "arrow". Pythagorean theorem: 
x 
2
 +y 
2
 +z 
2

--dot_product(): This tells you how much two vectors are pointing in the same direction. The result is a single number, not a vector. A dot product of 0 means the two vectors are exactly perpendicular.

--cross_product(): This calculates a new vector that is perpendicular to both of the original vectors. This is very useful in 3D graphics and physics for finding a "normal" vector.

--normalize(): This is the process of creating a "unit vector". A unit vector has the same direction as the original vector, but its magnitude (length) is exactly 1. It's calculated by dividing each component of the vector by its own magnitude.
