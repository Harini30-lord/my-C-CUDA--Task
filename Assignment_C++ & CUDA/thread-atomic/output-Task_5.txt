--- Lock-Free Smart Pointer (Simplified) Demonstration ---

=== Correctness (Single-Threaded) ===
Ptr1 use_count: 1
Ptr1 use_count: 2, Ptr2 use_count: 2
Ptr1 use_count: 3, Ptr3 use_count: 3
Ptr1 use_count: 1 (new obj), Others use_count: 2
Ptr2 reset. Ptr3 use_count: 1
After block, s_instance_count: 0
--- Single-threaded correctness verified ---

=== Benchmarking and Multi-threaded Stress Tests ===
Running with 8 threads, 100000 iterations per thread.
Total pointer copies/resets/deletions affecting shared pointer: Approx 8000
Total pointer operations (copies/resets) on local pointers: Approx 1600000
