Of course. Here is a README.md file for the C++ expression evaluator code.

This file explains the project's purpose, how the parsing logic works, how to compile and run the code, and what to expect from the output and its error handling.

"C++ Mathematical Expression Evaluator":

This project is a simple, command-line C++ program that can parse and evaluate basic mathematical expressions provided as a string. It is a demonstration of a Recursive Descent Parser, a common and elegant way to handle structured text like arithmetic formulas.

\\\

"Features:"
Basic Arithmetic: Supports addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

Operator Precedence: Correctly handles the order of operations (multiplication and division are evaluated before addition and subtraction).

Parentheses: Allows for parentheses () to override the default operator precedence.

Error Handling: Detects and reports common errors such as division by zero, mismatched parentheses, and invalid syntax.
///

**********
The hierarchy of function calls enforces the order of operations:

--parseExpression() (Lowest Precedence: +, -): This function's job is to handle addition and subtraction. It does so by calling parseTerm() to get the values that need to be added or subtracted.

--parseTerm() (Medium Precedence: *, /): This function handles multiplication and division. It calls parseFactor() to get the values that need to be multiplied or divided.

--parseFactor() (Highest Precedence: () and numbers): This function handles the parts of the expression with the highest priority. It either parses a number directly or, if it finds an opening parenthesis (, it makes a recursive call back up to parseExpression() to solve the sub-expression inside the parentheses.

This chain of function calls naturally enforces the rule that operations inside parentheses are evaluated first, followed by multiplication/division, and finally addition/subtraction.

**********


Error Handling:

The program is wrapped in a try...catch block to handle potential issues during parsing gracefully. It can detect and report several types of errors:

Division by Zero: As seen in the output for 10/0.
Mismatched Parentheses: If an expression like (1+2*3 is given.

Invalid Syntax: If the expression contains unexpected characters or doesn't follow a valid structure.

When an error is detected, the program prints a descriptive error message to the console and returns 0 as the result for that evaluation.
